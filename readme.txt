EM3 GOLEM Upgrade Notes:
- All 15 GOLEM Upgrades are compatible with the GOLEM AI, if an upgrade does not appear in the list, it probably just works how you would expect
- Upgrades can be toggled with the 'activate' and 'deactivate' debug commands (e.g. 'deactivate deviance', 'activate all'
- Deviance: only doubles incoming damage when the swap shield is down
- Doubt: works how you would expect, but it is worth noting that Doubt enables the boss to swap into the player at will, as the cost will be refunded upon swapping out
- Euphoria: instead of slowing time, the GOLEM will speed up by a factor of 2 similarly to max Perceptual Downsampling
- Hubris: when its swap shield is low, the GOLEM will attempt to swap early in order to avoid a post-mortem

- Indulgence: if certain conditions are met and the GOLEM has enough energy, it will perform a chain swap like it does in phase 2
- Obsession: the set of upgrades given to the chosen host is randomly selected from preset upgrade builds, the chosen host type also gets a new skin when possessed by the GOLEM
